# doordash-robot-automation
**Product Management**

**Objective: automating Doordash short-distance deliveries with robots**

**The study case**:
Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required.
Your team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).

This project consisted of 4 parts:

## 1. Pitch a Product Vision

My goal was to research this opportunity, create a pitch deck for the product, and then present it.

## 2. Run a Design Sprint

For this project, I went through [the stages of Design Sprint](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview) on my own by simulating some of the group activities (brainstorming and decision process). My goal was to develop a concept that would address an opportunity I have identified.

## 3. Manage the Product Development Process

For this project, I dealt with various scenarios that a PM typically faces or is expected to carry out during the development phase:
- Create a project blueprint that can be used by either by the PM or the involved stakeholders to understand their role, task and targeted milestone.
- Plan for a sprint meeting to ensure that the team is able to understand and focus on the deliverable.
- Respond to different scenarios that may require the PM to reprioritize the sprint backlog or manage expectations with stakeholders accordingly.
- Understand the API documentation and use this information to engage with the scrum team accordingly.

*Instructions for the API*: Your solution requires directions and distance between robot and destination (could be restaurant/delivery address). Your engineering lead shared Google Distance Matrix API and Google Direction API s a reference to what information would be available when you leverage Doordash API to build. Reviewing the documentation, you noticed that walking and bicycling information is available via the API with rich attributes that can be leveraged to help the Operations team in multiple ways.

## 4. Deliver a Product to the Market

For this project, I simulated a product launch. I developed the go-to-market strategy, outlined a launch plan, identified potential problems and defined the next iteration of the product.

*Post-launch data*

Week:	Number of deliveries

week 1:	100

week 2:	300

week 3:	500

week 4:	500

week 5:	600

*Field Feedback*: The DoorDash Operations team is generally very happy with your product, but in about 25% of the deliveries with the robots, there are some issues. You believe that it is because the operations team misses some of the robots malfunction. What can you do to address this item?
